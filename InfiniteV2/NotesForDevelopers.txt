FOR ALL FUTURE DEVELOPERS


NOTE:

Memory Optimization
1. Limit ammount of used bytes in a variable: (if an int never reached more than 127 in value use std::int_fast8_t or std::int8_t) 
NOTE: MAX AND MIN VALUES IN A VARIABLE IS STORED AS A DEFINE
2. Do not keep pointers and variables for longer than needed
3. Avoid using tangled code (pointers not freed)

Function Optimization:
1. Do not make super long functions
2. Follow code structures like in the rest of the code
3. Avoid using function pointers when not required (can make code harder to debug)

Speed Optimization:
1. A quick google search can help you find far faster algorithms
2. Learn some god damn math to speed up your code
3. Use inline on functions called often 



## Optimization and Code Example


TREAT ALL WARNINGS AS ERROR
PLEASE KEEP TRACK OF YOUR POINTERS
PLEASE AVOID LAMBDAS, FUNCTION POINTERS AND RECURSION

optimized func
avoid heavy math operations and Cache reused vars
in Client->cache
float MathFunc(const Vec2& a) { use const type& for 
function that require structs as inputs (less memory and stack)
    return Math::Sqrt( a.x * 0.5f ); AVOID DIVISIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
    ex. USE *0.5f instead of / 2.f; (far faster)
    do not Math functions outside of Math:: (more optimized)
}

void Func() {
    float SomethingA = 0.f;
    { use brackets for values whom have temp use 
    so they dont exist throughout the function
        float TempVal = 0.f;
        CS::DoSomething(&TempVal);
        SomethingA *= TempVal;
    }
}

namespace { use namespaces for functions that are hooks
or do not require members (ex. int thing = 1;)
    void Function(); 

    inline void DoThing(float a); for functions  
    which are short use inline on them
    to decrease stack usage per function
};

class CSomeClass { for classes use this naming system
public:
    void Func();
    std::int8_t Member; do not waste space and only
    use int sizes u use
};
extern* CSomeClass SomeClass; use extern because slightly faster
CSomeClass* SomeClass = new CSomeClass();

struct Struct_t { use this naming for struct that are not 
related to menu
    void* thing;
};

enum A : std::int8_t { enum memebers are all caps
make sure to use ints with bits used
IF YOU DONT USE MORE THAN 8 BITS DONT USE std::int32_T
    THING = 0
};
