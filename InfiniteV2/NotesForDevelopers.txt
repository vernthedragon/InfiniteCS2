FOR ALL FUTURE DEVELOPERS


NOTE:

Memory Optimization
1. Limit ammount of used bytes in a variable: (if an int never reached more than 127 in value use std::int_fast8_t or std::int8_t) 
NOTE: MAX AND MIN VALUES IN A VARIABLE IS STORED AS A DEFINE
2. Do not keep pointers and variables for longer than needed
3. Avoid using tangled code (pointers not freed)

Function Optimization:
1. Do not make super long functions
2. Follow code structures like in the rest of the code
3. Avoid using function pointers when not required (can make code harder to debug)

Speed Optimization:
1. A quick google search can help you find far faster algorithms
2. Learn some god damn math to speed up your code
3. Use inline on functions called often
